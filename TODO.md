## Endpoint response freshness

A response only refreshes when its code block is emptied, so once written it stays, and a year-old response looks the same as one fetched today. Readers, and agents especially, can't tell whether an example still holds. Responses now record the date they were fetched (`<!-- raindown:fetched 2026-10-14 -->`), but nothing checks they still match.

**Check mode.** `raindown file.rd --check` re-runs every endpoint without writing, and exits non-zero listing the responses that no longer match, for CI. Needs a way to ignore fields that change every request (ids, timestamps), for example an `ignore:` list on the directive or a JSON path list.

## Code feelings

Ideas for the feelings screen, roughly most useful first.

1. **Jump to the next unfelt method.** Felt methods go blank, so late in the week the grid is mostly empty, and the arrows step through cells there's nothing left to do in. `n` and `N` could jump to the next or previous unfelt method in reading order.
2. **Undo the last feeling.** One wrong key, like `1` instead of `2`, notes a feeling straight away, and the only way back is feeling it again. `u` could remove the last row from `feelings.csv` and select its method again.
3. **Click a bin to feel the selected method.** The bins are drawn, but clicking them does nothing, as they have no click events. With hover already working, Code feelings could be used with the mouse alone.
4. **The hovered method's name in the status line.** The code box doesn't follow the mouse, so while hovering, the status line could show `lib/text.rb:62 · Text#segments_between`, and "This week's code to feel" otherwise.
5. **Esc collapses an expanded code box.** Esc only does something while a note's being typed.
6. **How many are left, beside "39% refined".** Like "12 left", which says more near the end of the week.
7. **A scroll hint when an expanded box pushes rows off the grid.** A faint `↑` or `↓` at the grid's edge, so it's clear it's scrolled.
8. **A resize during the celebration** can pick a bigger batch, with unfelt methods, while the rain or waffle carries on. Not picking again until the celebration's over would fix it.
